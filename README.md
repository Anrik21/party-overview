# Party Overview
A quick overview about the players that have tokens placed on the currently active scene. At a glance, you will see

Vitals (hit points, wounds)
Inspiration, Hero Points, Bennies, Advantage.
Defenses (Armor Class, Saving Throws)
All languages your players might know and which one of them can speak said language.

Using filters, you can hide and show players to your hearts desire, to quickly get the information you need in the heat of the battle.

## Examples

All prints are from PF2e's implementation since it's the system where I play in.

## General

Hero Points, HP, AC, Perception, Fortitude, Reflex, Will

### Caveats and additional information

- Only tokens that are owned by players will appear in the list: Assign those permissions by right-clicking on the Actor in the sidebar, then select "Permissions" and set "Owner"-role to one of the configured players.
- When switching scenes, the list will automatically update to show only the currently active players.
