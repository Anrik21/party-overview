# vtta-party
A quick overview about the players that have tokens placed on the currently active scene. At a glance, you will see

* Current and maximum hitpoints
* Armor Class
* Passives: Perception, Investigation and Insight

You can hide and show every player and filter by visibility to quickly access the information you need in the heat of the battle.

Futhermore, you can enable or disable tooltips showing those vital stats (besides the HP) when hovering over a token. Granulary access
controls can define if this module and/or the tooltips are available for GMs and assistants only, or of player can use the overview 
to plan ahead, too.

### Caveats and additional information

* Only tokens that are owned by players will appear in the list
* When switching scenes, the list will automatically update to show only the currently active players

## Configuration
You can set three options for this module, which define who can use the two parts of this module: The overview window and the tooltips.

* You can grant players the access to the overview window
* You can enable or disable tooltips globally
* You can allow players to have the tooltips, too, but right now, they can only see the tooltips on tokens that they own.
